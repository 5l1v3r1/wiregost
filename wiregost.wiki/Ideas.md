## Modules

#### Payloads

Add Description field for payloads: generate a "payload_id_description" to the same directory, and
load this description when showing payloads saved when using this workspace.
The payloads would be those generated by payload modules.

#### Auxiliary

Refine auxiliary classification if there is a reasonable set of common patterns that would allow
for refactoring.
