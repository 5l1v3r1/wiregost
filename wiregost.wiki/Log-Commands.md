While there are different ways to see WireGost logs, one of them is through the client's console.

In addition, logs specific to a user are saved into its own personal directory, so that he can see
his own work history without it being mixed with other users.

The commands and parameters availables for visualizing client-specific logs are the following:

#### Commands

* `log.global `                _Shows last x number of lines of global log_
* `log.exploit `               _Shows exploit specific log_
* `log.payload `               _Shows payload specific log_
* `log.listeners`              _Shows payload specific log_
* `log.db `                    _Shows database specific log_


#### Parameters

* `log.global.path`            _Path to global log for this workspace (default to current workspace path)_
* `log.exploit.path`           
* `log.payload.path`           
* `log.handlers.path`          
* `log.db.path`
