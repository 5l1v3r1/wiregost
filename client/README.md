## Client

The `client/` directory contains the code necessary to run a client shell.
This code never imports any code from the `server/`.

* `core/`       - Client state management
* `events/`     - Handles events from Wiregost
* `help/`       - Console help
* `util/`       - Various utilities needed by the client/console
* `spin/`       - Console spinner library
* `transport/`  - Wires the client to the server (gRPC connection code)
* `version/`    - Version information
* `main.go`     - Entrypoint
