## Module

The `module` package contains the implementation of modules in Wiregost, as well
as templates for each module type. The goal is obviously to provide maximum reusability
and modularity to Wiregost's components and agents.

Go in the `templates/` directory for further information on each bundled module type.

----
## Package Structure

* `module.go`       - Implementation of module interfaces, (defining their usage in Wiregost)
* `templates/`      - Containing directory templates for each type of bundled module (exploit, post, auxiliary)

----
## Bundled Module

The main goal of the following package structure, and the model of "bundled modules"
is to provide locality of information for each module. However, some modules may only use
a subset of the available bundle structure (ie payloads, scanners, listeners)

* `module.go`           - Core functionality of the module, with Run(), Init(), Reload() functions.
* `metadata.json`       - Module information and options, loaded during module initialization
* `lib/`                - Code used by the module's core if needed (only Go code in there)
* `docs/`               - Any documentation relevant to the module
* `src/`                - Any non-Go source code needed by the module (ie PowerShell scripts for a Post module)
* `data/`               - Mostly any non-Go executable file, or platform-specific build information, needed by the module

----
### Notes

* The `module.go` file should always have this name, as Wiregost will look for it when loading/using the module.
* This same file is a template, with core function signatures, that the user just needs to fill with module-specific logic.
